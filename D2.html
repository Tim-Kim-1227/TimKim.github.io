          do not worry. Here, you have several options in starch and protein. For your starch, you may choose
          between fried rice and rice. Once you choose your starch, you can choose one protein, which includes
          curry or a stir-fried dish. Not to mention, <em>Currylicious</em> also has biryani, in which you can
          have both starch and protein at once. Dishes will change every day but trust me. Regardless of the
          menu you choose, you will always be satisfied with the quality and taste of the dish.
