# Visiting D2 In Two Years

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
    This website is built for those who are not used to the renwed D2 this semester. I believe comsuming food is one of the most important experience one can have on         this campus. Returning to school in two years, I was confused by the renewed counters and menu items when I first entered D2. For the first few days of the school,       I had to read and ask about the menus before ordering any foods. And because of this, getting foods in D2 was often stressing. This would be true for other students     who left the school before vendor changed or who is new to the school!

    To help those in my situation, I wanted to create an easily accessible virtual guide to D2, so no one has to ask each counter what they serve. Through this               website, I hope students can have better sense of what food options they have in D2. The website had to be concise yet informative as much as possible, which was         very challenging to find balance between the two.

    This website removes the students' needs to physically explore the D2, which I consider to be a waste of time and energy, so they can think about foods they want to     eat even before they visit D2.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
    Implementing the concept of this website was a fairly simple process. Using the wireframe that I have desgined before diving into HTMLs or CSSs, I was able to         relatively quickly place elements on the page. However, as mentioned above, I had to find a balance between the amount of information and the readability of the site. To do this, appearance of the website is very simple, using only three colors: white, black, and blue. Initially, I tried to use multiple colors that increase appetites, but I later found out use of multiple colors may distract visitors from reading website's contents. Not to mention, I utilized tables to provide a description of each counter in order to maximize readability of large information.

    <h2>Reflection/Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
    Overall, I think I have achieved 80% of what I initially thought my final version to be. Although I have tried my best to provide information to visitors, I was not able to give full information because I had to consider readability of the webiste. The part that I failed to shorten the information is apparent in my "D2" page, where some descriptions are actually longer than the image heights. I need more "storytelling" skills in order to further increase the amount of information in a given space. This will also improve the design of the wesbite since I will be able to manage appropriate ratio between text length and the images. Additionally, my images, though each of them is royalty-free, is not orginal image of D2. In my personal opinion, this harms the origniality of my website. If I had finished html and css earlier, I would have been able to get missing image files.
